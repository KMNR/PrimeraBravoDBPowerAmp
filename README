= DBPoweramp Disc Loader For Primera Bravo =

This software is two disc loader programs to use a Primera Bravo with DBPoweramp.

== Using This Software ==

To use the software compile it using code::blocks. I recommend using the release
build option instead of the debug build option. To create the loader, navigate
to the BatcheRiper\loader folder in your DBPoweramp folder and create a folder
(for example bravo) and create Load, Unload, and Reject folders within that.

1. Rename the LoadDisc.exe executable to Load.exe and place it in the Load folder.
1. Rename the UnloadDisc.exe executable to Unload.exe and place it in the Unload folder.
1. Rename the UnloadDisc.exe executable to Reject.exe and place it in the Reject folder.

This loader uses the PTBurn server to manipulate the robot since Primera doesn't provide
direct manipulation drivers. As such, things can get a little sketchy! If you've moved the
PTBurnJobs folder from the default C:\PTBurnJobs folder to a different location you'll
need to edit the source and recompile.

The LoadDisc.exe and UnloadDisc.exe applications will both stay open (and block the
batch ripper software) until a disc is loaded. I have seen issues where the programs will
hang on exit and consume 100% CPU, but compiling with release and checking the fstreams
more frequently seems to have solved that issue.
